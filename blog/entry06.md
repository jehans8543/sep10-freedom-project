## How I Made my MVP

### Wireframes:
The first step for when it came to making our MVP is creating a wireframe, that way I would be able to know how to organize my website, instead of thinking of a layout on the stop. It was sort of used as a guide for me, with me not needing to actually follow it step by step. 
#### Wireframe For Large Viewport:

![Wireframe-2-desktop](../img/new-2-d.png)
![Wireframe-3-desktop](../img/new-3-d.png)

While making my wireframe for a large viewport, it wasn't much of a struggle since I had the ideas in my head all planned out. Also when it came to making wireframes for larger viewports in general I tend to struggle less since larger viewports five me more freedom to do add more content. Whereas for my wireframe for smaller viewports I found myself struggling. 

#### Old Version of Wireframe for Smaller Viewports:

At first when I submitted the mobile version of my wireframe, I was confident that I would be approved immediately, that is I untill I saw the comment that Mr.Mueller put on my wireframe telling em that I the two wireframes are virtually the same and that my mobile wireframe would have to look more responsive. And after taking in his feedback and look at the mobile vesrsion of my wireframe, I realized that he was right, it didn't look responsive at all. 

I realized that the mobile version of my website, the cards that I was going to use would have to stack on top of each other in order for it to be more easily readable by the viewer, which is the main thing that I changed about the mobile version of my wireframe. 

#### Updated Version of Wireframe for Smaller Viewports:

![Wireframe-2-updated](../img/updated-wireframe-2.png)
![Wireframe-3-updated](../img/updated-wireframe-3.png)

As you can see in my new updated wireframe, I fixed the mistakes and took in the feedback that I was given by Mr.Mueller. This time I changed my cards so that they stacked on top of each other, and
