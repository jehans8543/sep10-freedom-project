## In-Class Presentations
After submiting the final version of our website, we now had to do **in-class presentations**. The in-class presentations is in order for us to introduce our website to everyone in our class. It's also our way for Mr.Mueller to grade us on our website and presentation. 

What we had to do first is create slides, which was the main thing we go off while we were presenting:

For my slides I decided to make the theme based off the theme for my website, in order to keep a correlating theme. 

For the slides the requirement was to make sure that it was **condensed**, and that we memorized what we had to say. Another requirement was that we had to make **eye contact** and **project our voices**. If we did not follow the requirements he would have took off points from our grades. Which ended up happening to me.

In terms of the presentation, I decided to pick #2, which would mean that I would go early on, the reason that I picked this is because I wanted to get it over it. And when it was my turn, I was not prepared at all and barely practiced my slides. Therefore when I was giving my presentation I started making things up on the spot, though it turned up better than I expected. 

After all the presentations were completed Mr.Mueller returned our grades for our project and our presentation:

As you can see aboove I got a 10/10 on my product, which I sort of expected becasue of the amount of effort that I put in, and the fact that I ensured that I didn't miss anything on the rubric. As for the presentation I expected my grade not to be a 10/10 because of my eye contact, which I know I didn't make enough of during my presentation. Since I was mainly looking at the slides to think of what to say. 

After reading my feedback for my presentation, I realized that I have to be more prepared for my presentation, and think of what I'm gonna say beforehand that way I can maintain eye contact with the audience. 

## Expo
In the middle of in-class presentations the expo happened. And luckily for me the expo happened after I finshed the presentation that I gave in class. Which made it easier for me to know what I have to improve on, in preperation for the expo. 

The catch was that we couldn't use our slides, and isntead we only had to rely on our website and the _elevator pitch_ that we would have to create. 

The requirements for the elevator pitch was for it to be under a minute and for it to cover all the main points of your website. Creating the elevator pitch was fairly easy for me to do, with it taking around 10 minutes for me to come up with:

Writing the elevator pitch was easy, though the toughest part was to memorize it

### Day of the Expo
During the day of the expo it's safe to say that I was extremely unprepared. I didn't take the time to memorize my elevator pitch, which made my presentation awkawrd in the begining. 

First period of the expo the people who visited me was mainly my friends, so it was hard for me to be serious during my presentation. Though once some other people start to come, whom I didn't know, I started to make things up on the spot which made me sttuter and hesitate a lot. 

When I had no one visting my website, I took time to look over my elevator pitch and took time memorizing it. By the time the judges came, I believe that I gave a pretty solid presentation and description of my website. Though something I believe I could have done differently is explain my reserach and inventions a bit more. Though other than that I was sastisfied with my project in the end. 

Later that day during our SEP period, Mr.Mueller announced the finalists and the honorable mentions in my class. And I found that **_I was one of the honorable mentions_**. I was both shocked at this news but also wasn't too surprised at the same time, because of the amount of effort I put in my website. After I heard this announcement I was extremely proud of myself and the work I done this year. 

## EDP 
We are at the final stage of our EDP, since we are officially finished with the freedom project and its contents this year. We were judged from the student judges who were in our positions in the expo, and it felt like a rewarding experience since it feels like the work that I did all year was being recgonized and judged properly. Which made me proud of my work.

## Skills 
### Effort
Throughout the whole freedom project, I realized that if you want to get far with something you have to **put effort in**. Without putting the effort in you won't be able to get far, especially when it comes to projects like these, when you are given a large amount of freedom. The more freedom that you are given the more effort that you would have to put in order for it to stand out. With the amount of effort that I put in my project, I was able to get it recgonized for that effot by getting honorable mention. 

### Preperation
One of the major skills that I learned is that you always have to be prepared. For the in class presentations I found myself being extremly unprepared, with my jamabling informnation together, making me lose points. As for the expo I was also unprepeared and had to memorize everything last minute. If I came into my project more prepared, I believed that my presentations would have recieved full points. And that I would have gotten a over higher rating in general. Now that I learned the importance in preparation, I can incooperate that for my next presentations and freedom projects next time. 

## Takeawys
Overall I believe that the freedom project was a impactful experience. Though I had mixed feelings about it at first, and complicated ones while creating the website. I still believe that the freedom project for me was an impactful experience, because it allowed me to further delve into my passion for law, and ensuring myself that I want to presure it in the future. And for the future I plan to do more of my freedom projects about law and exploring different aspects of it.
