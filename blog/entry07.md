## In-Class Presentations
After submiting the final version of our website, we now had to do **in-class presentations**. The in-class presentations is in order for us to introduce our website to everyone in our class. It's also our way for Mr.Mueller to grade us on our website and presentation. 

What we had to do first is create slides, which was the main thing we go off while we were presenting:

For my slides I decided to make the theme based off the theme for my website, in order to keep a correlating theme. 

For the slides the requirement was to make sure that it was **condensed**, and that we memorized what we had to say. Another requirement was that we had to make **eye contact** and **project our voices**. If we did not follow the requirements he would have took off points from our grades. Which ended up happening to me.

In terms of the presentation, I decided to pick #2, which would mean that I would go early on, the reason that I picked this is because I wanted to get it over it. And when it was my turn, I was not prepared at all and barely practiced my slides. Therefore when I was giving my presentation I started making things up on the spot, though it turned up better than I expected. 

After all the presentations were completed Mr.Mueller returned our grades for our project and our presentation:

As you can see aboove I got a 10/10 on my product, which I sort of expected becasue of the amount of effort that I put in, and the fact that I ensured that I didn't miss anything on the rubric. As for the presentation I expected my grade not to be a 10/10 because of my eye contact, which I know I didn't make enough of during my presentation. Since I was mainly looking at the slides to think of what to say. 

After reading my feedback for my presentation, I realized that I have to be more prepared for my presentation, and think of what I'm gonna say beforehand that way I can maintain eye contact with the audience.
