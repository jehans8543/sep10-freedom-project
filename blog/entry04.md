## Choosing a Tool 
The tool that I ended up choosing was called _Animate.CSS_ which was one of the mild options from the tool list. Originally I thought that I was going to use the tool _A-frame_, but after reseraching about it a bit I realized that it would be hard to connect it with my topic, Government. A-frame is used to create 3D models, and though it would have been interesting to make a model of my topic, it would have been hard for me to do so since my topic is more of a system rather than a physical. Therefore I decided it's best to do Animate CSS, my second choice, since it would enhance the visual appearance of my website. 

### What is Animate.CSS?
[Animate.CSS](https://animate.style/) is considered to be a library of premade cross-browser animations for your webpage, with it the simplicty being able to greatly enhance your webpage. In order to use Animate.CSS you can either install it with an _npm_, _install with yarn_, _impoprt it into your file_, or _add it directly to your webpage using a CDN_. When it came to installing Animate.CSS I used the adding it to your webpage option using a CDN:

```HTML
<head>
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css"
  />
</head>
```
