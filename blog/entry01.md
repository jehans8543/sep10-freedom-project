## Choosing a Topic

The topic that I choose to my project around is the government. The reason why I decided to choose the government is becasue of my interest working in that feild in the future. Even though I am still not fully sure that this is what I want to do, I believe that making my project centered around it will allow me to understand have an understanding and a idea of what it really is about. Allowing me to find out if I am truly interested working in the government, rather than finding out later. 

Despite me choosing to make my project about the technolgies used in the government, there were stil other topics that I considered as well. These topics being law practices/firms and physics. The reason why law practices/firms were an option is because is closest similarity to the government, and physics because my enjoyment in learning about it in class. 

### Articles that I Thought About/Explored:
* [Physics Laboratory Equipment](https://www.labkafe.com/blog/physics-laboratory-equipment-a-complete-list-of-important-equipment-and-their-uses/) by "Ashish Bharadwaj
  * The reason why I found this article interesting is because I was able to see the equipment that I used in class and was able to connect that to the concept of the project.
* [Tech Gadgets Shaping Legal Excellence in 2024](https://www.legalpracticeintelligence.com/blogs/technology-intelligence/tech-gadgets-shaping-legal-excellence-in-2024?srsltid=AfmBOooURbI9GoukfZ5-kBb1vwG3dbTZqxoW2r1EO7LCSmwU9vQVL26w) by "Legal Practice Intelligence"
  * This is another article that I found interesting because it showed how technology start to impact and change the way people work. Many will expect that working as a lawyer will not really require much technolgy, to only find out it's starting to have a larger impact that we think.
* [Revolutionizing Technology: The Role of Physics in Modern Innovations](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/revolutionizing-technology-role-physics-modern-happy-keshri) by "Happy Keshri"
  * This is an article that I explored because it shows the direct connection that technology had in the development in physics. How without it we will be serverly behind in our discoveries in physics.

Despite all of these articles being quite intriguing by itself. It did not inspire nor push to make my project centered around it. Even though I came into this reserach process knowing that I wanted to make my project about the government, searching articles about convinced me even further. 

### Articles about the Government:
* [Technology in the public sector and the future of government work - UC Berkeley Labor Center](https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/technology-in-the-public-sector-and-the-future-of-government-work/) by "Sara Hinkley"
  * This article convinced me because I was able to find genuine interests while reading it. And was able to make continuous ideas in how I can incude this information my project.
* [Government Technology | IDEA Analytics](https://analyticsbyidea.com/government-technology/) by "Idea Analytics"
  * I found this article convincing as well becuase it gives a thorough explanation about how technology is used in the government, and how it benefits the feild for the better. It also shares expectations of the technology is the future and how it will further improve than what it is now.
