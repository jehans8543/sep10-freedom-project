# Entry 1: Deciding on a Topic (Government)
##### 10.07.2024

## Choosing a Topic

The topic that I choose to make my project centered around is the **government**. The reason why I decided to choose the government is because of my interest in working in that field in the future. Even though I am still trying to figure out what I want to do, I believe that making my project centered around it will allow me to understand what it is aboutâ€”allowing me to find out if **I am truly interested in working in the government**, rather than finding out later. 

Despite my choosing to make my project about the technologies used in the government, there were still other topics that I considered as well. These topics are **law practices/firms** and **physics**. My justification for why law practices/firms were an option is because of their similarity to the government. I also considered physics because I enjoyed learning about it in class. 

#### Articles that I Thought About/Explored:
* [Physics Laboratory Equipment](https://www.labkafe.com/blog/physics-laboratory-equipment-a-complete-list-of-important-equipment-and-their-uses/) by "_Ashish Bharadwaj_"
  * The reason why I found this article interesting is because I was able to see the equipment that I used in class and was able to connect that to the concept of the project.
* [Tech Gadgets Shaping Legal Excellence in 2024](https://www.legalpracticeintelligence.com/blogs/technology-intelligence/tech-gadgets-shaping-legal-excellence-in-2024?srsltid=AfmBOooURbI9GoukfZ5-kBb1vwG3dbTZqxoW2r1EO7LCSmwU9vQVL26w) by "_Legal Practice Intelligence_"
  * This is another article that I found interesting because it showed how technology started to impact and change the way people work. Many will expect that working as a lawyer will not require much technology, only to find out it's starting to have a larger impact than we think.
* [Revolutionizing Technology: The Role of Physics in Modern Innovations](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/revolutionizing-technology-role-physics-modern-happy-keshri) by "_Happy Keshri_"
  * This is an article that I explored because it shows the direct connection that technology had in the development of physics. How without it we will be severely behind in our discoveries in physics.
 
Despite all of these articles being quite intriguing by themselves. It did not inspire nor push me to make my project centered around it. Even though I came into this research process knowing that I wanted to make my project about the government, searching articles about it convinced me even further. 

#### Articles about the Government:
* [Technology in the public sector and the future of government work - UC Berkeley Labor Center](https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/technology-in-the-public-sector-and-the-future-of-government-work/) by "_Sara Hinkley_"
  * This article convinced me because I was able to find genuine interest while reading it. I was also able to make continuous ideas about how I can include this information in my project.
* [Government Technology | IDEA Analytics](https://analyticsbyidea.com/government-technology/) by "_Idea Analytics_"
  *  I found this article convincing as well because it gives a thorough explanation of how technology is used in the government, and how it will benefit the field for the better. It also shares expectations of future technology and how it will further improve than what it is now.
