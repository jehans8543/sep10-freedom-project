## Choosing a Topic

The topic that I choose to my project around is the government. The reason why I decided to choose the government is becasue of my interest working in that feild in the future. Even though I am still not fully sure that this is what I want to do, I believe that making my project centered around it will allow me to understand have an understanding and a idea of what it really is about. Allowing me to find out if I am truly interested working in the government, rather than finding out later. 

Despite me choosing to make my project about the technolgies used in the government, there were stil other topics that I considered as well. These topics being law practices/firms and physics. The reason why law practices/firms were an option is because is closest similarity to the government, and physics because my enjoyment in learning aboout it in class. 

### Articles that I Thought About/Explored
* [Physics Laboratory Equipment](https://www.labkafe.com/blog/physics-laboratory-equipment-a-complete-list-of-important-equipment-and-their-uses/)
  * The reason why I found this article interesting is because I was able to see the equipment that I used in class and was able to connect that to the concept of the project.
* [Tech Gadgets Shaping Legal Excellence in 2024](https://www.legalpracticeintelligence.com/blogs/technology-intelligence/tech-gadgets-shaping-legal-excellence-in-2024?srsltid=AfmBOooURbI9GoukfZ5-kBb1vwG3dbTZqxoW2r1EO7LCSmwU9vQVL26w)
  * This is another article that I found interesting because it showed how technology start to impact and change the way people work. Many will expect that working as a lawyer will not really require much technolgy, to only find out it's starting to have a larger impact that we think.
