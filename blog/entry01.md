# Entry 1: Deciding on a Topic (Government)
##### 10.07.2024

## Choosing a Topic

The topic that I choose to make my project centered around is the **government**. The reason why I decided to choose the government is because of my interest in working in that field in the future. Even though I am still trying to figure out what I want to do, I believe that making my project centered around it will allow me to understand what it is aboutâ€”allowing me to find out if **I am truly interested in working in the government**, rather than finding out later. 

Despite my choosing to make my project about the technologies used in the government, there were still other topics that I considered as well. These topics are **law practices/firms** and **physics**. My justification for why law practices/firms were an option is because of their similarity to the government. I also considered physics because I enjoyed learning about it in class. 

#### Articles that I Thought About/Explored:
* [Physics Laboratory Equipment](https://www.labkafe.com/blog/physics-laboratory-equipment-a-complete-list-of-important-equipment-and-their-uses/) by "_Ashish Bharadwaj_"
  * The reason why I found this article interesting is because I was able to see the equipment that I used in class and was able to connect that to the concept of the project.
* [Tech Gadgets Shaping Legal Excellence in 2024](https://www.legalpracticeintelligence.com/blogs/technology-intelligence/tech-gadgets-shaping-legal-excellence-in-2024?srsltid=AfmBOooURbI9GoukfZ5-kBb1vwG3dbTZqxoW2r1EO7LCSmwU9vQVL26w) by "_Legal Practice Intelligence_"
  * This is another article that I found interesting because it showed how technology started to impact and change the way people work. Many will expect that working as a lawyer will not require much technology, only to find out it's starting to have a larger impact than we think.
* [Revolutionizing Technology: The Role of Physics in Modern Innovations](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/revolutionizing-technology-role-physics-modern-happy-keshri) by "_Happy Keshri_"
  * This is an article that I explored because it shows the direct connection that technology had in the development of physics. How without it we will be severely behind in our discoveries in physics.
 
Despite all of these articles being quite intriguing by themselves. It did not inspire nor push me to make my project centered around it. Even though I came into this research process knowing that I wanted to make my project about the government, searching articles about it convinced me even further. 

#### Articles about the Government:
* [Technology in the public sector and the future of government work - UC Berkeley Labor Center](https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/technology-in-the-public-sector-and-the-future-of-government-work/) by "_Sara Hinkley_"
  * This article convinced me because I was able to find genuine interest while reading it. I was also able to make continuous ideas about how I can include this information in my project.
* [Government Technology | IDEA Analytics](https://analyticsbyidea.com/government-technology/) by "_Idea Analytics_"
  *  I found this article convincing as well because it gives a thorough explanation of how technology is used in the government, and how it will benefit the field for the better. It also shares expectations of future technology and how it will further improve than what it is now.

 ## Engineering Design Process
I am currently in the **first stage** moving onto the **second stage** of the engineering desigm process, where in the first stage I have to define what it is I want to do. What I mean by this is that I have to be able to figure out what I am **interested** in creating for the rest of the school year. As for me I was able to get past this stage pretty quickly, because of me knowing that I want to research about the government right off the bat. 

Since I am complete with the first stage, I am now slowly moving onto the **second stage**, where I have to conduct in-depth research on my topic. Since I choose to make my project about the government my research has to be about _technology in the government_. Though I have not done much research as of yet, some of the information that I already know is technologies that are currently being used by the government. Such as _automation_, a robotic process that is used to fill out paperwork, look at property records, and collect government fees and fines. Another piece of technology that I learned about is _digital government correspondence_, allowing public workers to pass information through their departments and others as well as federal and state governments, etc.

## Skills 

#### How to Google
While I was researching different technologies in each profession, I could not find exactly what I was looking for. Instead, I kept on finding different variations of what I wanted, despite my wanting to find exactly what I was looking for. That's where I found out I could use **quotation marks** (" ") around the exact word or phrase that I wanted to appear in the search results. Which made it easier because I found more accurate search results than what I wanted. If I did not want something to appear in my search I would have to use the **minus symbol** ( - ). Allowing me to reduce the search results of unnecessary information. 

#### How to Read 
While researching what topic I wanted to do, I dreaded the fact that I had to read multiple articles. That is when I found out that I didn't need to read the full article, instead, it would be easier if I **skimmed** through them instead. Though I could have been at risk of missing key information, I learned that the easiest way to find important information in the text is by searching for a word or phrase within it. You can do this by pressing **CTRL + f** causing a little search box to pop up allowing you to search within the task. Learning this skill made my time researching much more efficient.
