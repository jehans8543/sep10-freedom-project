# Entry 2: Researching about Softwares and Hardwares 
##### 11.04.2024

## Narrowing Down my Topic 
During my search on finding softwares and hardwares about my topic, I came to realize that my topic, _government_ , is quite a broad topic to begin with. The government can refer to many things, such as government organizations, the federal government, infrastructure government, and etc. 

### Softwares 
While researching for softwares, I had to use different keywords, that are associated with the type of government I want to focus my project on. Though I had a new problem arise, which was that I didn't really know what kind of government I wanted to focus on in the first place. 

#### Search: "Political Apps"
Since I was still indecisve of what kind of government I wanted to reserach on, I decided the best way to help me decide is research of different types of governments, for example _political government_, which in my mind meant what are softwares related to the political aspects of the government. 

When I searched this up I was first taken to a university website of political apps to try on your smart devices. It had a variety of apps to choose from and when I clicked on one of them it took me to a political news outlet:

* The website that I found relating to this search, was [The Washington Post](https://subscription.washingtonpost.com/mobile/)
  * Recommendeds posts get personalized to your liking
  * Able to use the app on apple or fire tv
  * Requires a subscription for some of the news
  * Audience of republican candidates
  * News about our political situation and our overall government
  * Made to be used as a mobile app

#### Search: "Court Apps"
While I was thinking about what is the next key word to serach up, I realized that I wanted my reserach to stick with a theme. That is having government topics that relate to law in general. Allowoing me to conclude with the key word _court_ which the government has a huge involvement in. 

The first search result that popped up was an app from the Google Play Store 

* The app is called [eCourt Services](
  * Provides information about cases filed in subordinate courts and high class courts all throughout the country
    * Can configure which one you are interested in seeing and knowing about.
  * Made for the assistance Citizen, Litigants, Lawyers, Police, Government Agencies and other Institutional Litigants
  * Only available for android.

#### Search: "Democratic Government Apps"
When I was thinking of the key words for my next search, I thought of the upcominng government elections. And all of a sudden I thought of a the word **_Democratic_** which does connect to our government and how it functions. 

One of the first search results was from [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) itself, though more specifically it led to a page of the Apple app store. 

The app that I found was called [POLITICO](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/politico/id358305912)

* Up to date with the latest political news
  * News about the United States government such as the presidential election, and our presidents in general

### Hardwares 
After reserarching about **_Softwares_** you would think it would be easier to find hardwares, since I now have experience searching for these types of topics using key words. But instead it was the **opposite**. No matter how many keywords that I used in my seraches I still could not find any hardwares that would relate to my topic. 

I was only able to get past my challenge because of Mr.Mueller's help. He told me that I could use _AI_ in order to find more information. I was a bit skeptical at first, since I was always told to never use AI in school. It's even blocked on the schools's wifi. Though Mr.Mueller told me that it's okay to use AI in certain scenarios, especially in this one since it will help push my thinking, and get more specific searches. 

#### Search: “Communication infrastructure that is used in the government”
When I serached up "hardwares in the government" using _ChatGPT_, it told me about infrastructures in the government.
