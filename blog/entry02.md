# Entry 2: Researching about Softwares and Hardwares 
##### 11.04.2024

## Narrowing Down my Topic 
During my search on finding softwares and hardwares about my topic, I came to realize that my topic, _government_ , is quite a broad topic to begin with. The government can refer to many things, such as government organizations, the federal government, infrastructure government, and etc. 

### Softwares 
While researching for softwares, I had to use different keywords, that are associated with the type of government I want to focus my project on. Though I had a new problem arise, which was that I didn't really know what kind of government I wanted to focus on in the first place. 

#### Search: "Political Apps"
Since I was still indecisve of what kind of government I wanted to reserach on, I decided the best way to help me decide is research of different types of governments, for example _political government_, which in my mind meant what are softwares related to the political aspects of the government. 

When I searched this up I was first taken to a university website of political apps to try on your smart devices. It had a variety of apps to choose from and when I clicked on one of them it took me to a political news outlet:

* The website that I found relating to this search, was [The Washington Post](https://subscription.washingtonpost.com/mobile/)
  * Recommendeds posts get personalized to your liking
  * Able to use the app on apple or fire tv
  * Requires a subscription for some of the news
  * Audience of republican candidates
  * News about our political situation and our overall government
  * Made to be used as a mobile app

#### Search: "Court Apps"
While I was thinking about what is the next key word to serach up, I realized that I wanted my reserach to stick with a theme. That is having government topics that relate to law in general. Allowoing me to conclude with the key word _court_ which the government has a huge involvement in. 

The first search result that popped up was an app from the Google Play Store 

* The app is called [eCourt Services](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.gov.ecourts.eCourtsServices&hl=en_US)
  * Provides information about cases filed in subordinate courts and high class courts all throughout the country
    * Can configure which one you are interested in seeing and knowing about.
  * Made for the assistance Citizen, Litigants, Lawyers, Police, Government Agencies and other Institutional Litigants
  * Only available for android.

#### Search: "Democratic Government Apps"
When I was thinking of the key words for my next search, I thought of the upcominng government elections. And all of a sudden I thought of a the word **_Democratic_** which does connect to our government and how it functions. 

One of the first search results was from [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) itself, though more specifically it led to a page of the Apple app store. 

The app that I found was called [POLITICO](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/politico/id358305912)

* Up to date with the latest political news
  * News about the United States government such as the presidential election, and our presidents in general

* Available for iPhone and iPad
* If you log into your account for the app, it’s easy to save any article that you want

### Hardwares 
After reserarching about **_Softwares_** you would think it would be easier to find hardwares, since I now have experience searching for these types of topics using key words. But instead it was the **opposite**. No matter how many keywords that I used in my seraches I still could not find any hardwares that would relate to my topic. 

I was only able to get past my challenge because of Mr.Mueller's help. He told me that I could use _AI_ in order to find more information. I was a bit skeptical at first, since I was always told to never use AI in school. It's even blocked on the schools's wifi. Though Mr.Mueller told me that it's okay to use AI in certain scenarios, especially in this one since it will help push my thinking, and get more specific searches. 

#### Search: “Communication infrastructure that is used in the government”
When I serached up "hardwares in the government" using _ChatGPT_, it told me about infrastructures in the government. And though it did not really connect to the theme that I was going with, I still thought it would be fun to do some reserach on it. 

The website that I found was called: [Critical Infrastructure Sectors](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/communications-sector)

* Energy Sector
  * Gives power for cellular towers to run central offices, and other critical communications facilities and also relies on communications to aid in monitoring and controlling the delivery of electricity.
  * Allows us to have a stable energy supply, which allows our health and welfare to not be threatened.
  * Requires different plans, risk management frameworks. 
  * ![image](https://theonebrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/renewable-energy-banner-2.jpg)
* Information Technology Sector
  * Central to national security, economy, public health, and etc.
  * Produces and provides hardware, software, and information technology systems and services.
  * ![image2](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cd064a_85f455fbec9d4f7aacd1f0c07db3c356~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_560,h_268,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/cd064a_85f455fbec9d4f7aacd1f0c07db3c356~mv2.jpg)
 
#### Search: "Security Systems in the Government" 
After seraching for **_infrastructure hardwares_** in the government, I decided it will make sense to stick with a theme when it came to my hardwares. _ChatGPT_ told me that another topic I could search up is _Security Systems_, and I thought that in order for infrastructure to happen you would need a proper security system. Allowing me to use seccurity systems to be one of the topics that I reserach about. 

The website that I found is ["Office of Security"](https://www.commerce.gov/osy/programs/physical-security/electronic-security-systems#:~:text=Physical%20Access%20Control%20Systems%20PACS)

* Physical Access Control Systems (PACS)
  * Enterprise intelligence systems of hardware and software deployed to control accesses through perimeter entries, internal control points, and protected spaces
  * include, but are not limited to, Personal Identity Verification card readers, door controllers, turnstiles, request to exit devices, door position switches/sensors, electric door strikes, Fiber Optic cabling infrastructure, middleware, switches, and servers.

 ## Engineering Design Process
I am currently on the **second stage** of the engeneering design process, where I am trying to reserach the problem that is connected to my topic. What I mean by this is that I have to find what sorts of technologies, whether it be hardwares and softwares that are used in the government. As I mentioned this earlier, getting past this stage was difficult for me to do, because of the broadness of my topic. Though I was able to get past this because of the advice of what Mr.Mueller told me about using _ChatGPT_. 

I don't believe that I am fully done with the second stage of the egeneering design process because I still haven't found the problem that I am dealing with. Sure I may have found a lot of information on the softwares and hardwares that are used in the government, but I haven't found any issues related to it thus far. Therefore I would have to narrow my topic down even further then I already did, in order to find some visible issues that can be found in the governmnet, which is what I believe my **_next steps_** are for the engeneering design process. 

## Skils 

#### How to Research 
As I mentioned earlier, I struggled a lot when it came to reseraching about my topic, especially when it came to the hardwares that I had to reserach about. Even when using keywords and quotation marks in my google searches, I still could not find anything that would conenct to my topic. By this point I was beyond frustrated, even contemplating on changing my topic. That is until I asked Mr.Mueller for help, and he told me to use _ChatGPT_ as an resource when it comes to reseraching. At first I was hesitant, since I was always told **_not to use AI_** in school, but I was told it was okay when it comes to the small stuff such as research. I learned that if you just search up what it is your looking for, you can find narrowed down answers. For example, when I serarched "hardwares in the government" I found answers such as _infrastructure hardwares in the government_ and after finding that answer I would serach up in google, and I would find more specific serach results.
