## Synthesizing My Research 
After reseraching for **softwares** and **hardwares** for my topic, I realized that I started to see a reoccuring pattern between the information that I have gathered. And for our next task for our freedom project we were told to synthesize all the information that we have. Meaning that we had to catoegorize our information into groups. We were told that it was okay for some of our reserach to go into more than one group, as long as it makes sense. 

### Informative Softwares 
The reason why I choose to name this group _informative softwares_ is because they are softwares that informs and updates citizens about what is happening within their government. 

* The app that I found was called [POLITICO](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/politico/id358305912)
  * Up to date with the latest political news
    * News about the United States government such as the presidential election, and our presidents in general
  * Allows news to be accessible to everyone, allowing people to be aware of our country’s political state
  * Has information about the political news of certain states
  * Available for iPhone and iPad
  * If you log into your account for the app, it’s easy to save any article that you want
* The app is called [The Washington Post](https://subscription.washingtonpost.com/mobile/)
  * Recommended posts get personalized to your liking
  * Able to use the app on apple or fire tv
  * Requires a subscription for some of the news
  * Audience of republican candidates
  * News about our political situation and our overall government
* The app is called [eCourt Services](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.gov.ecourts.eCourtsServices&hl=en_US)
  * Provides information about cases filed in subordinate courts and high class courts all throughout the country
    * Can configure which one you are interested in seeing and knowing about.
  * Made for the assistance Citizen, Litigants, Lawyers, Police, Government Agencies and other Institutional Litigants
  * Only available for android.

### Security Hardwares 
The reason why I choose to name this group _security hardwares_ is because they are all hardwares that have something to do with sercurity. Since the government is considered to be a broad topic, putting all my hardwares into one group that connect to each other, will make it easier for me to make connections later in my project. 

* Physical Access Control Systems (PACS)
  * Enterprise intelligence systems of hardware and software deployed to control accesses through perimeter entries, internal control points, and protected spaces
  * Include, but are not limited to, Personal Identity Verification card readers, door controllers, turnstiles, request to exit devices, door position switches/sensors, electric door strikes, Fiber Optic cabling infrastructure, middleware, switches, and servers.
* Video Surveillance Systems (VSS)
  *  deployed to surveil required points of facilities according to ISC standards and/or as designated by the security organization
* Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
  *  programmed to detect intrusion into certain protected spaces, such as facility perimeter spaces (perimeter access locations like doors, windows, roof hatches, etc.)
  *   IDS communicate alarms to monitoring stations to signal for the appropriate response to the alarmed location.
* Information Technology Sector
  *  Central to national security, economy, public health, and etc.
  *  Produces and provides hardware, software, and information technology systems and services.

#### Overall Synthesization 
When it comes to synthesizing my information I learned how much easier it makes the whole process be. Being able to categorize my information, made it so much more easier for me to think of what I am going to say when it comes to the later on planning of the HTML on my website. 

## Part B (Thinking of Innovations) 
After finishing part A, we were ready to move onto part B, which was _thinking of innovations_. Though these innovations, had to be new with the purpose to solve the problems related to your topic. Since my topic is government, which is quite broad, I was able to think of multiple innovations targetting different types of problemes centered around my topic. 

### Corruption Monitoring System 
* Using AI to analyze financial transactions, looking for patterns to detect if any fraud is happening
* Public dashboards showing how tax dollars are spent
* Financial systems to track all public spending transparently in real time.
  
### National cybersecurity neural network 
* Self-learning neural network that detects and neutralizes cyberattacks in real time
* Coordination for public and private networks for seamless cybersecurity defense
* Automated stress tests for critical government systems

### Decentralized digital identifying system
* Unified access to healthcare, voting, and tax services through this id
* Integration with global standards for international travel and global security
* Block-chained based digital id that securely stores personal data, only accessible with citizen consent

### AI-Powered Education Reform System 
* Adaptive learning platforms tailored to a students needs
* AI systems to monitor and improve teacher performance
* Real-time dashboards for governments to assess educational outcomes and allocate resources

I struggled a lot to think of innovations that would connect to my topic, and in order to come up with this soild list of inventions, I had to do a lot of reserach for problems that already exist in the government. I also had to find different types of technologies that did not exist yet, or were similar to the one I thought of so I would not interlap with anything that is already exisiting. If anything I beleive the hardest part of this whole journey thus far was thinking of inventions. 

## Engineering Design Process 
So far in the I officially finished up the research portion of part A in the EDP, and now I am **_offically starting_** part B where I would have to look ahead and think of the future. When I say think of the future, I would have to think of innovations that could be created in the furutre that could solve the problems that are currently seen in my topic. Starting part B, as I have mentioned earlier, was quite difficult for me because most of part B required creativity, which is something that I myself don't have much of. In order for me to overcome this challenge, I had to do a lot of reseraching, and taking the time to further go in depth and understand my topic. 

In order for me to fully get past Part B, I believe I would have to do further in depth reserach of the inventions that I came up with. That way I would be able to get an idea of how the prototype hardware version and software version of my innovation looked like if it were to become an acutal invention. Therefore I believe in order to get past part B my **_next steps_** are to think of how a prototype for this invention would look like. 

## Skills

### Organization 
One of the most crucial skills that I learned during my time of synthesing is being able to organize. Since when it means to synthesize something it means to make or combine two or more things. And you might be wondering how this might to relate to organizaiton, since when you are synthesizing you are organizing information that is similar to one another.
