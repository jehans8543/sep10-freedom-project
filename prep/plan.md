|  Xin Yu | I really like how, each section with the title, it like have some kind of physics to it, like its jumping. And I think overall the website is very smooth espeically with the background of an government building  | I think there should be a diversity in text fonts
| Ekrar  | I  think the different sections are really organized and neat. I also really like how the title for each section moves, I also really like the background image.  | I think you could improve on the mobile design for your website. When I change the window to be smaller the website doesn't fit. So it should be more responsive.
|  Crystopher | I like how some of the headers have cool animations. There is a lot of text that relates to the topic. The image at the top really surpised me. | For some of the information you can try to change the fonts and add some color so as to make it seem vibrant. Also the cards for software section seem to be out of place when viewing with a smaller screen size.
|Benson|I like how the website is formatted and it looks very organized.|I think that the navbar should have some padding because it feels too close to the edge and the softwares section the cards are overlapping each other and not resposnive.
| Darren | It is cool how your headers move and have animations.  | Your columns are not working properly in some areas. The problem is likley that you added margin which columns don't calculate for. To fix this put another div inside the divs with the columns and add padding on the divs with column to have the same affect.
