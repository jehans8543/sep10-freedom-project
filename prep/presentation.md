# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Real-World Scenario of the government, and connect it back to my content in a subtle way

## Product
* Gifs of certain portions my website,
  * Ensuring that they show off the animated parts of my webpage
* Clip some of the content written on my webpage
  * Condensing them, and then adding the bullet pointed version on my slides

## Process
* Screenshots of the wireframes
  * Showing the multiple versions of the wireframes and how
  * Including the feedback I got on the wireframes
* Showing the research that went behind my tool
* Showing the resources that I used to enhance my code
* Code Snippets:
  * MVP and final product
    * Comparing and contrasting the different code

## Conclusion
* _URL of the webpage_
* Takeaways
  * "Interest follows action"
    * Go in depth about how I started to accumulate an interest in computer science, and how the freedom of creating something and anything allowed me to gain that interest
  * Self-Teaching (Connect this back to learning about animate.css, and how I had to relearn how to use bootstrap)
    * Process on learning how to learn, and how you utilize every resources that is given or found allowing you to consume more information. Though the most effective method of self-learning is interacting with what you learned yourself.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
