# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Animate.CSS**

---

### 03/09/2025:
* Created a subdirectory folder in my tool folder, in order to practice what I learned
  * Created a HTML file for my code
  * installed animate.css
* I visited the [Animate.CSS](https://animate.style/) website
  * Read the section about **Delay classes**
    * type of class
    * different types of delay speeds, applicable with any animation
      * `animate__delay-2s	2s`
* Practice.html
  * used `animate__bounceOut` to test out the delay feature
    * When trying out the delay count I could not notice any differences
    * tried difference animations and speeds to see if there was a difference
* Next Steps:
  * Watch youtube videos surrounding animation delays

  * when your changes contains more than one step then you need to use animation
  * `@keyframes`
   * Assigns animation rule to an element
   * then give animation an name 
  * Sequence of animation used with percentages
    * 0% - begining, 100% - end
  * You need to be specific when to animate what CSS property
  * `animation-timing-function`
    * Makes the timing of an animation more specific
  * Linear - consistent speed
  * Ease - smoother speed
* [CSS Animation 28 - animation delay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RrTJY_z36c&ab_channel=VirtualAddiction)
  *  Defines when an animation will start
  * Begins execution sometime after it is applied
  * The numeric value represents an offset, defines how long of an delay there is going to be
* Next Steps:
  * Taking what I learned and incoorprating it into my code
  * Conencting the animations I learned from the videos with _Animate.CSS_
