### 03/09/2025:
* Created a subdirectory folder in my tool folder, in order to practice what I learned
  * Created a HTML file for my code
  * installed animate.css
* I visited the [Animate.CSS](https://animate.style/) website
  * Read the section about **Delay classes**
    * type of class 
    * different types of delay speeds, applicable with any animation
      * `animate__delay-2s	2s`
* Practice.html
  * used `animate__bounceOut` to test out the delay feature
    * When trying out the delay count I could not notice any differences
    * tried difference animations and speeds to see if there was a difference
* Next Steps:
  * Watch youtube videos surrounding animation delays
